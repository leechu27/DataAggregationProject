My name is Yunan Shi. My preferred name is Anny. I am a fourth-year student at University of Toronto Scarborough studying Computer Science and specialist in software engineering. I am a team player. I have built my communication skill from my work experience as a TA for first-year computer science course. I am comfortable with Java, Python, and C. I also know some SQL scripting, C++, HTML, VBA, CSS, XML.  I have 2 four-month work experience. I worked 4 months as a System Analyst for TTC and also 4 months as an Application Programmer for the Ministry of Education. I am taking CSCC01 because it is fun and it connects what we learn to what we are going to do and how we are going to do them in the future. I also take it because I need it to graduate.
I am aiming for 4.0 and fun, meaningful experience.
