My name is Chun Ho Lee and I'm a third year Computer Science Specialist at the University of Toronto at Scarborough.
I am a team player and like to stay on top of the work given to me. My most proficient programming languages are 
Python, Java, and C. I am currently interested in the Computer Security aspect of Computer Science. I hope to be able
to complete a successful project in CSCC01. I like to lead if no one else steps up to lead but my past experiences
leads me to believe it is easier to be a follower than leader so I hope if someone does lead, that he or she is capable.
My expectations for this course is that I will be able to feel comfortable in the workplace after experiencing the work
cycles we will do throughout the coming weeks.
