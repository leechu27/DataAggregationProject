To test the creation of a new database:
	- Delete the test.db file inside of codeEc
	- Run database setup
	- Connect with sqlite studio to see whether the database has connected
	- Any queries that we want to run on the code, we must verify on sqlite studio
		that it works on the dummy database before we apply it to production

To test what happens when you run DatabaseQuery again:
	- Use sqlite studio to verify that no information has been overwritten
